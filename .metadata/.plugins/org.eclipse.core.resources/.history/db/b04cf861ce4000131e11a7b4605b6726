 * Class Rectangle represents a rectangle.

 * Properties of class Square
 * referencePoint - where is the square located
 * height  of the square. The width of the square will be automatically the same as the height.
 * lastMousePosition - the last position where the mouse was pressed, 
 * 						useful when moving the square
 * colorSquare - color of the square
 * shapeSelected - a boolean variable which is true if the square is 
 * 					selected for moving 
 * 
 * Properties of class Square (See below for more details)
 * changeColor - modify the color of the square
 * changeShape - modify the width or the height of the square
 * moveShape - move the square by dragging the mouse 
 * shapeIsSelected - mark a square as "selected" by pressing the mouse button inside the square
 * resetShapeSelected - reset the shapeSelected flag
 * calculateArea - determine the area of the square
 * showMe - display the square inside the frame
 * toString - return a string describing the square.
 * savePositionWhereUserPressedMouse - useful when dragging the shape
