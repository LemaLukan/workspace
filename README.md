Plagiarism
==========
most things in this repository is related to the courses I've taken at University of Windsor or the University of Athabasca, in the spirit of show casing my knowledge and approach to problems.
None of this gives permission for any plagiarism of material for any other purpose.

Eclipse Java files
===========
The major portion of University courses in both Athabasca and Windsor require coding in Java. I use eclipse to manage my classes and assignments, so this repository will contain everything related to java.
